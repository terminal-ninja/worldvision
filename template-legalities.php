      <h2><span style="color: #ff9900;">Child Protection Policy</span></h2>
      <p align="justify">Ensuring the safety, security and dignity of the children we work with.By using any of the services on this website (<a title="World Vision South Africa" href="http://www.worldvision.co.za">www.worldvision.co.za</a>), you consent to the terms below.</p>
      <p align="justify">The wellbeing of all girls and boys is a foundational commitment in all World Vision’s activities.</p>
      <p align="justify">World Vision South Africa is committed to protecting the security, privacy, and dignity of the children whose parents, guardians and community leaders have graciously allowed them to be a part of our child sponsorship programmes. Our engagement with the children is governed by this policy and it is also applied for their protection in relation to the web sponsorship process.</p>
      <p><strong>Child Security</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">Children have the right to be completely secure from the fear or reality of any potential abuse (either physical or emotional) resulting from an inappropriate contact by a sponsor or any other person.</p>
      <p align="justify">We release only limited information about the children. We don’t include last names, community names or locations, or any other information that might identify the location of the child. We intentionally withhold this information until after the identity of the sponsor is verified.</p>
      <p align="justify">All World Vision workers and projects strictly adhere to the child protection standards below so that children are not exposed to exploitation or abuse at any level at any time.</p>
      <p><strong>Child protection standards</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>A sponsor will be allowed to meet a child only in the presence of World Vision staff and a parent/guardian of the sponsored child.</li>
      <li>A central location such as the World Vision project office will be the meeting place of a sponsor with his/her sponsored child. Private locations such as hotels or private residences will not be encouraged.</li>
      <li>Where permitted by law, a background check or verification of the sponsor/visitor will be carried out.</li>
      <li>No unannounced visits to children by sponsors or supporters will be allowed.</li>
      <li>The community around the sponsored child will be encouraged to report any unauthorised visits and World Vision will attempt to thwart such activity.</li>
      <li>Any requests for volunteering and social work in our programme locations will be entertained only after rigorous verification of the requests are carried out, and must happen under the supervision of World Vision staff.</li>
      <li>Anyone (staff or sponsor or other persons) suspected of child abuse or inappropriate behaviour will be dealt with severely. Action taken may include a criminal investigation as well as a severance of employment or relationship.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Recordkeeping and confidentiality</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">All records about the sponsored children and their families, along with information regarding their status, will be kept and maintained in strict confidentiality by World Vision offices. Home address/contact details of sponsors or children will not be shared between them.</p>
      <p><strong>Child Privacy</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">We take potential misuse of child photographs on the web very seriously. Children and their families are assured that World Vision is protecting the integrity of the information about themselves that they’ve given us, including photographs. Privacy also demands that children, their families and communities be shielded from any potential inappropriate contact from sponsors or others.</p>
      <p align="justify">That’s why we don’t allow downloading, copying, or replicating photos or other information relating to children and their communities on this website without our prior written permission. Child profiles are presented for the purpose of conveying appropriate information about the sponsorship relationship, and are not to be distributed.</p>
      <p align="justify">World Vision monitors the web for inappropriate use of these images and we are committed to use any means legally possible to stop any possible misuse and to ensure the prosecution of offenders.</p>
      <p><strong>Child Dignity</strong></p>
      <p align="justify">World Vision will ensure that all communication about children will portray them as dignified citizens of the country. No attempt will be made to portray them as victims unwarrantedly, neither will any communication exaggerate or glamorise the poverty and challenges faced by the child.</p>
      <p align="justify">The lives of children, their families, and members of their community should be represented with accuracy and dignity. We consider the children we work with as our partners, working with us to help bring holistic transformation to communities living in poverty. We seek the full, informed consent of parents, guardians, and/or community leaders for a child’s participation in our child sponsorship programmes.<br />If you have any questions about any of these policies, <a title="Contact World Vision" href="http://localhost:800/worldvision/contact/">contact us</a></p>
