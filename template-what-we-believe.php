Where families are valued, creation preserved and the most vulnerable live in security and confidence. Where they become responsible citizens of well-led nations. Where peace and justice reign and all have the right to contribute. Where they flourish in a world where the treasure of our hearts and the measure of our wealth is the happiness and well-being of all children. In such a world, we all taste the joy of the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

      <div id="tabs-2">
        <p style="text-align: justify;">As World Vision persons we are members of various local churches and/or denominations.
        Most of these groupings have their own formal creeds. The founders of World Vision, believing that
        our activities should be undergirded by a few straightforward confessional commitments, elected to
        adopt the following Statement of Faith and it is now included in our new Constitution, to wit:</p>

        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy
          Spirit.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and His personal return in power and glory.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> the Bible to be inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> that for the salvation of lost and sinful man regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved until the resurrection of life and they that are lost unto the resurrection of damnation.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We believe</strong> in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.</li>

        <h1 style="text-align: justify;">World Vision Statement of Core Values</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE ARE CHRISTIAN</strong>. We acknowledge one God; Father, Son and Holy Spirit. In Jesus Christ the love, mercy and grace of God are made known to us and all people. From this overflowing abundance of God’s love we find our call to ministry.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We proclaim together, “Jesus lived, died, and rose again. Jesus is Lord.” We desire him to be central in our individual and corporate life.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We seek to follow him — in his identification with the poor, the powerless, the afflicted, the oppressed, the marginalised; in his special concern for children; in his respect for the dignity bestowed by God on women equally with men; in his challenge to unjust attitudes and systems; in his call to share resources with each other; in his love for all people without discrimination or conditions; in his offer of new life through faith in him. From him we derive our holistic understanding of the gospel of the Kingdom of God, which forms the basis of our response to human need.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We hear his call to servanthood and see the example of his life. We commit ourselves to a servant spirit permeating the organisation. We know this means facing honestly our own pride, sin and failure.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We bear witness to the redemption offered only through faith in Jesus Christ. The staff we engage are equipped by belief and practice to bear this witness. We will maintain our identity as Christian, while being sensitive to the diverse contexts in which we express that identity.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE POOR.</strong> We are called to serve the neediest people of the earth; to relieve their suffering and to promote the transformation of their condition of life.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We stand in solidarity in a common search for justice. We seek to understand the situation of the poor and work alongside them towards fullness of life. We share our discovery of eternal hope in Jesus Christ.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We seek to facilitate an engagement between the poor and the affluent that opens both to transformation. We respect the poor as active participants, not passive recipients, in this relationship. They are people from whom others may learn and receive, as well as give. The need for transformation is common to all. Together we share a quest for justice, peace, reconciliation and healing in a broken world.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE VALUE PEOPLE.</strong> We regard all people as created and loved by God. We give priority to people before money, structure, systems and other institutional machinery. We act in ways that respect the dignity, uniqueness and intrinsic worth of every person — the poor, the donors, our staff and their families, boards and volunteers. We celebrate the richness of diversity in human personality, culture and contribution.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We practice a participative, open, enabling style in working relationships. We encourage the professional, personal and spiritual development of our staff.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE ARE STEWARDS.</strong> The resources at our disposal are not our own. They are a sacred trust
        from God through donors on behalf of the poor. We are faithful to the purpose for which those resources are given and manage them in a manner that brings maximum benefit to the poor.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We speak and act honestly. We are open and factual in our dealings with donor constituencies, project communities, governments, the public at large and with each other. We endeavor to convey a public image conforming to reality. We strive for consistency between what we say and what we do.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We demand of ourselves high standards of professional competence and accept the need to be accountable through appropriate structures for achieving these standards. We share our experience and knowledge with others where it can assist them.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE ARE PARTNERS.</strong> We are members of an international World Vision Partnership that transcends legal, structural and cultural boundaries. We accept the obligations of joint participation, shared goals and mutual accountability that true partnership requires. We affirm our inter-dependence and our willingness to yield autonomy as necessary for the common good. We commit ourselves to know, understand and love each other.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are partners with the poor and with donors in a shared ministry. We affirm and promote unity in the Body of Christ. We pursue relationship with all churches and desire mutual participation in ministry. We seek to contribute to the holistic mission of the church.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We maintain a co-operative stance and a spirit of openness towards other humanitarian organizations.
        We are willing to receive and consider honest opinions from others about our work.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are stewards of God’s creation. We care for the earth and act in ways that will restore and protect the environment. We ensure that our development activities are ecologically sound.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WE ARE RESPONSIVE.</strong> We are responsive to life-threatening emergencies where our involvement is needed and appropriate. We are willing to take intelligent risks and act quickly. We do this from a foundation of experience and sensitivity to what the situation requires. We also recognize that even in the midst of crisis, the destitute have a contribution to make from their experience.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are responsive in a different sense where deep-seated and often complex economic and social deprivation calls for sustainable, long-term development. We maintain the commitments necessary for this to occur.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We are responsive to new and unusual opportunities. We encourage innovation, creativity and flexibility. We maintain an attitude of learning, reflection and discovery in order to grow in understanding and skill.</p>

        <h1 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="24">OUR COMMITMENT</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">We recognise that values cannot be legislated; they must be lived. No document can substitute for the attitudes, decisions and actions that make up the fabric of our life and work. Therefore, we covenant with each other, before God, to do our utmost individually and as corporate entities within the World Vision Partnership to uphold these Core Values, to honor them in our decisions, to express them in our relationships and to act consistently with them wherever World Vision is at work.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="tabs-4">
        <h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="24">INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In 1978 the Boards of the several “incorporating members” of an enlarged and restructured World Vision International met “to be launched by the Holy Spirit upon a new venture in partnership and ministry” (Declaration of Internationalization, 31st May, 1978). Under the guiding, correcting and enlightening influence of the same Holy Spirit, we have seen the Partnership so launched extend to encompass over sixty national entities.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Our corporate pilgrimage has brought us to new understandings of relationship and ministry. Sensing the need to express these shared understandings as a framework for joint global action, a Covenant of Partnership has been formulated. The Covenant is based on the principle of interdependent national entities held together, under God, by voluntary commitment rather than legal contract. On this basis the national entities are envisaged as functioning in a complementary, cohesive manner in which national interests are recognised, but are regarded as secondary to the larger whole. We affirm the spirit of citizenship in the Kingdom of God described in Ephesians; “…fellow-citizens with God’s people and members of God’s household, built on the foundation laid by the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the foundation-stone.” (Ephesians 2: 19, 20)</p>

          <h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="24">ELEMENTS OF PARNERSHIP DEFINED</h2>
          <strong>The World Vision Partnership</strong> refers to the entire World Vision family throughout the world. Any expression of the World Vision ministry is in some way connected to the Partnership. The word “Partnership” is used in this document in a broad, informal sense, rather than a legal sense.
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>World Vision National Entities</strong> comprise the membership of the Partnership. The conditions and categories of membership are described in the By-Laws of World Vision International. All function with the guidance and advice of a National Board or Advisory Council.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>World Vision International (WVI)</strong> is the registered legal entity which, through its Council and Board of Directors, provides the formal international structure for the Partnership.</p>
          <strong>The WVI Council</strong> provides the membership structure for the Partnership. It meets every three years to review the purpose and objectives of World Vision, assess the extent to which they have been accomplished and make recommendations to the WVI Board in relation to policy. All member-entities are represented on the Council.
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The WVI Board of Directors</strong> is the governing body of WVI as outlined in the By-Laws. The membership of the Board is broadly representative of the Partnership and is appointed by a process determined by the Partnership.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Global Centre</strong> within our federalist model is the international office of the World Vision Partnership often operating from locations around the Partnership. It has operational responsibility Covenant of Partnership through the International President for stewarding all the entities of the global Partnership based on a defined set of reserved powers. It operates under the authority of the WVI Board of Directors.</p>

          <h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="24">THE COVENANT</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Regarding</strong> World Vision as a partnership of interdependent national entities,</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Affirming</strong> the principle of relationships based on commonly held mission, values and commitments,</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Acknowledging</strong> the process of internationalisation that has brought the World Vision Partnership to its present stage of development, and</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recognising</strong> the need for a statement of the rights and obligations of member entities,</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We</strong>, as a properly constituted national World Vision Board (or Advisory Council), do covenant with other World Vision Boards (or Advisory Councils) to:</p>

          <ol>

            <li>Engaging in direct, open dialogue with other entities on issues of tension or conflict, seeking constructive solutions that seem best for all concerned, and demonstrating the power of reconciliation in Christ.</li>
            <li>Fostering an open spirit of exchange for ideas, proposals, vision and concern within the Partnership.</li>
            <li>Encouraging board members and staff in their participation in the worship and life of a local church, which is important to our Christian existence and a sign of our corporate commitment to support the Church in her global mission.</li>
            <li>Empowering and enabling national offices so that decision making and accountability takes place as close as possible to those affected by the decisions (Federalist Principle of Empowerment).</li>
            <li>Accepting that WVI and the member entities can only achieve their shared mission by cooperating with each other (Federalist Principle of Interdependence).</li>
            <li>Making a commitment to honour both the work of the local and global organisation in the spirit of twin citizenship – recognising national interests, but appreciating them in the light of the good of the whole Partnership (Federalist Principle of Twin Citizenship).</li>
            <li>Mutually holding individuals, WVI and the member entities accountable for meeting behavioural expectations and making sure our commitments are upheld (Federalist Principle of Accountability).</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">WORK WITHIN THE ACCOUNTABILITY STRUCTURES BY WHICH THE PARTNERSHIP FUNCTIONS, by;
          <ol>

            <li>Executing an agreement with WVI to protect the trademark, name and symbols of World Vision worldwide.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that we establish no office or programme outside our own national borders without the consent of both WVI and the host country.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">OBSERVE AGREED FINANCIAL PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES, especially;
          <ol>
            <li>Using funds raised under the auspices of World Vision exclusively in World Vision approved ministries.</li>
            <li>Keeping overhead and fund-raising expenses to a minimum to ensure that a substantial majority of the funds raised are responsibly utilised in ministry among the poor.</li>
            <li>Remitting through WVI all resources intended for ministry outside of donor countries, with the exception of direct project funding under approved bilateral agreements.</li>
            <li>Being accountable for effective Financial Stewardship including Planning and Budgeting that is based on WVI policies and in alignment with the WVI Board approved framework for Partnership financial operations.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that funds or commodities accepted from governments or multi-lateral agencies do not compromise World Vision’s mission or core values, and that such resources do not become the major ongoing source of support.</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
            <li>PRESENT CONSISTENT COMMUNICATIONS MESSAGES, that;
          <ol>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Reflect our Christian identity in appropriate ways.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Include words, images, numbers and statistics that are consistent with ministry realities.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Avoid paternalism and cultural insensitivity.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Are free from demeaning and degrading images.</li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">Build openness, confidence, knowledge and trust within the Partnership</li>
          </ol>
          </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In signing the Covenant, we are mindful of the rich heritage of Christian service represented by World Vision and of the privilege which is ours to join with others of like mind in the work of the Kingdom of God throughout the world.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We therefore recognise that consistent failure to honour this Covenant of Partnership may provide cause for review of our status as a member of the Partnership by the Board of WVI.</p>
